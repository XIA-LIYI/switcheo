I choose jquery and Devextreme to solve this problem.

(1) Simple validation rules are applied.
    i. ETH address is 40 digits of hash.
    ii. Amount is a positive real number.
    iii. OTP is 6 digits of number.
(2) Confirmation page is used.
(3) If transfer is successful, form will be cleared. If transfer is unsucessful, form will not be cleared and user can edit their input.
